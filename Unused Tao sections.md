## Participation - Newcomers

Since its early years, participation in
the IETF has grown phenomenally. In-person
attendance at face-to-face meetings [now averages
between 1000 and 1500 participants](https://datatracker.ietf.org/stats/meeting/overview/).
At any given meeting, around 200 attendees are *newcomers* (defined by the IETF
as someone who has attended five or fewer meetings), and many of those go on to
become regular participants. When the IETF was smaller, it was relatively
easy for a newcomer to adjust. Today, however, a newcomer meets many more new
people -- some previously known only as the authors of documents or
thought-provoking email messages.

Of course, it's true that many IETF participants don't go to the face-to-face
meetings at all - especially since the COVID-19 pandemic when meetings were
completely online for a while. There also also many participants that solely
focus on the mailing lists of various IETF Working Groups. Since the inner
workings of Working Groups can be hard for newcomers to understand, this
document provides the mundane bits of information that newcomers will need in
order to become active participants. The IETF website also has a lot of
[newcomer
information](https://www.ietf.org/about/participate/get-started/) in various formats.
In this document we try to cover as much as possible in one place.

## Document intro

Many types of IETF documentation are mentioned here. 

## Activities

The ways to do that include the following:

- Identifying and proposing solutions to pressing operational and
  technical problems in the Internet.
- Specifying the development or usage of protocols and the near-term
  architecture to solve such technical problems for the Internet.
- Making recommendations to the Internet Engineering Steering Group
  (IESG) regarding the standardization of protocols and protocol usage
  in the Internet.
- Facilitating technology transfer from the Internet Research Task
  Force (IRTF) to the wider Internet community.
- Providing a forum for the exchange of information within the Internet
  community among vendors, users, researchers, agency contractors,
  operators, and network managers.

## About itself

The IETF is always evolving.  Although the principles in this document are
expected to remain consistent over time, practical details may well
have changed by the time you read it; for example, a web-based tool may have
replaced an email address for requesting some sort of action.

In many ways, the IETF runs on the beliefs of its participants. One of the
founding beliefs is embodied in an early quote about the IETF from David
Clark: "We reject kings, presidents and voting. We believe in rough consensus
and running code." Another early quote that has become a commonly-held belief
in the IETF comes from Jon Postel: "Be conservative in what you send and
liberal in what you accept."


### 2.1 Humble Beginnings

The first IETF meeting was held in January 1986 at Linkabit in San Diego,
with 21 attendees. The 4th IETF, held at SRI in Menlo Park in October 1986,
was the first that equipment vendors attended. The concept of Working Groups
was introduced at the 5th IETF meeting at the NASA Ames Research Center in
California in February 1987. The 7th IETF, held at MITRE in McLean, Virginia,
in July 1987, was the first meeting with more than 100 attendees.

After the [Internet Society](https://www.internetsociety.org) (ISOC) was formed in January 1992, the IAB
proposed to ISOC that the IAB's activities should take place under the
auspices of the Internet Society. During INET92 in Kobe, Japan, the ISOC
Trustees approved a new charter for the IAB to reflect the proposed
relationship.

## Meeting policy

The IETF met in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, in July 1993. This was the first
IETF meeting held in Europe, and the US/non-US attendee split was nearly
50/50. The IETF first met in Oceania (in Adelaide, Australia) in 2000, the
first meeting in Asia (in Yokohama, Japan) was in 2002, and the first meeting
in Latin America (in Buenos Aires, Argentina) was in 2016. So far, the IETF
has never met in Africa.

The IETF currently has a "1-1-1" meeting policy where the goal is to
distribute the meetings equally between North America, Europe, and Asia.
This policy is mainly aimed at distributing the travel effort for the
existing IETF participants who physically attend meetings and for
distributing the timezone difficulty for those who participate remotely. The
IETF has also met in Latin America and Oceania, but these continents are
currently not part of the 1-1-1 rotation schedule.
More information on picking the venue and the meeting policy can be found
in [RFC 8718: IETF Plenary Meeting Venue Selection Process](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8718)
and [RFC 8719: High-Level Guidance for the Meeting Policy of the IETF](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8719).

Remote participation in IETF meetings has been growing significantly in the
past few years, thanks in part to the ongoing effort to improve the tools and
processes used to facilitate this mode participation.
