# Tao of the IETF

This repo has the canonical Markdown source of the "Tao of the IETF", which is
published on [the IETF website](https://ietf.org/tao.html).

The `main` branch always has the current working copy. Pull requests should be
based off `main` and are merged into `main` when they are accepted.

When the current tip of `main` is published to the [IETF
website](https://ietf.org/tao.html), it is pushed to the `published` branch, and
a new tag in `YYYY-MM-DD` format is created based on the publication date.

Comparing the `main` and `published` branches hence always shows all currently
unpublished differences.
