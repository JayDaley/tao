It’s time for the Tao to evolve into a new set of documents that are written differently but cover much of the same subject matter.  The new documents that could come from the Tao are

- Introduction to the IETF
- How the IETF Works
- Participating in IETF Meetings
- Structure and Governance of the IETF
- The Culture and Folklore of the IETF

The key differences between the way this is written and the way the Tao is written are:

1.  Give full coverage to what matters without going into details on everything even if that means leaving some things unexplained or only vaguely touched on.  More detail can come in whichever of the three other documents is relevant.

2.  Instead of targeting the whole thing at newcomers, assume this will be of use to everyone and create specific parts for newcomers if needed.  The constant mention of newcomers in the Tao actually puts people off by labelling them and boxing them into a pre-defined role.  Better just to tell people the facts and let them decide how they fit in.

3.  Wherever possible say "this is what X is" rather than the regular Tao approach of "you might think X is … but no it’s actually … !!".

4.  Move almost all of the side remarks, insights into culture, memes, etc into a separate document, while still trying to capture the intent where needed.  It’s not that they’re without value, it’s just that they have a time and a place where they are most effective and that is when someone is already somewhat familiar with the IETF and can use those to consolidate their mental model, but not for newcomers.

5.  Fewer external references.  There’s a balance between referencing sources and providing additional information, and distracting people from the current document.
